# Acceptance criteria — FitFindr

Five criteria that say what "working" means for this agent, written in unit 3
**before** any results existed.

An acceptance criterion names a target: a number, a count, a rate, or something
a person could plainly observe. *"The agent handles errors"* is an opinion.
*"When search returns nothing, the agent stops before calling the second tool,
in 5 of 5 tries"* is a criterion.

Under each one, write a sentence or two on **why that target** and not a
stricter one. A reason that says something about your tools, your loop, or the
data earns credit; *"80% seemed reasonable"* does not.

> Missing your own targets next unit costs you nothing. Setting a target so
> easy you can't miss it does.

**Two are written for you. You write three.**

---

## 1. A matching query completes all three tools

Given a query that matches at least one listing, the agent completes all three
tool calls and returns a fit card — in at least 4 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**  
I chose 4 of 5 because the search uses keyword matching, so an unusual phrasing may fail to produce the expected result even when a relevant listing exists.

---

## 2. An impossible query stops before the second tool

Given a query that matches no listings, the agent stops before calling
`suggest_outfit` and returns a message naming what to change — 5 of 5 tries.

**Why this target:**  
I chose 5 of 5 because the empty-search branch is deterministic code. If the search returns an empty list, the agent should always stop before calling the next tool.

---

## 3. State preserves the selected item

For at least 4 of 5 matching queries, the item stored in `session["selected_item"]` must have the same `id` as the item passed into `suggest_outfit`.

**Why this target:**  
I chose 4 of 5 because the state flow should preserve the selected item across tool calls, while still allowing one unexpected failure to surface during testing.



---

## 4. Fit card contains the key details

In at least 4 of 5 tries, the fit card must be between 2 and 4 sentences and include the item, price, platform, and a specific styling vibe.

**Why this target:**  
I chose 4 of 5 because the model may vary its wording between runs, but the important listing and styling information should still appear most of the time.



---

## 5. Search respects the price ceiling

In 5 of 5 searches that include a price ceiling, `search_listings` must return no item priced above that ceiling.

**Why this target:**  
I chose 5 of 5 because price filtering is deterministic code rather than model generation, so the result should never exceed the user's maximum price.

     UNIT 4 — read this before you change anything above.

     If a criterion turns out to be BROKEN rather than merely unmet, you can
     revise it, and that earns credit. But never delete or edit the original
     line. Add the revision underneath it, like this:

         ## 4. Something about the fit card

         The fit card is different every time.

         **Why this target:** ...

         > **Revised in unit 4:** For 5 different items, the 5 fit cards share
         > no opening sentence.
         >
         > **Why revised:** "different" wasn't checkable — two cards that
         > differed by one word still counted. The new version is something I
         > can actually score.

     That's a revision because the criterion couldn't be MEASURED.

     Lowering a target because you missed it is not a revision, and it costs
     you the point:

         ✗ "I said the empty search stops it 5 of 5 times, but I got 3 of 5,
            so 3 of 5 is more realistic."

     A number you missed stays where it is, gets diagnosed, and gets a fix
     attempted. That's where the points are.
